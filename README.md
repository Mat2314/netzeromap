# Net Zero Map 
Project visualizing CO2 emission worldwide (per country) and analyzing potential solutions to lower the CO2 emissions and increase usage of the green energy. 

## Visualization
There will be a world map where we can see the following:

- How much CO2 is produced per country annually
- How many percent of country's energy production is the green energy
- How changing those numbers will affect global CO2 emissions 


## Machine Learning model
There will be a ML model that will try to predict the optimal actions for each country to efficiently achieve Net Zero emission.
